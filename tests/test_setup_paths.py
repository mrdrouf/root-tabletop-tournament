"""Regression tests for the two setup paths.

The mod has two ways to start a game -- the ranked draft (rttSetup) and the manual
4/5-board picker (setupFactionBoards) -- and historically they drifted apart: the
teardown tag list, the run-state reset, the busy release, the hand-1 ordering and
the turn system were each fixed in one path and forgotten in the other. These tests
drive BOTH paths against a stubbed TTS and assert they agree.
