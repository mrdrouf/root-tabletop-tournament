# RTT Work Queue

Single source of truth for outstanding tasks. Nothing is "done" until it's built, committed, and
the maintainer has confirmed it in TTS. Keep this file live: add every new request here the moment it lands,
tick items only when committed, and re-open anything the maintainer reports still broken.

## Standing rule: work on MAIN
From 2026-09-04 the working branch is **main**, not rtt-live ("we should be working in the main
branch"). main and rtt-live were fast-forwarded to the same commit; rtt-live is left pointing there so
any sync script still aimed at it keeps working, but it is no longer where work lands. Build, commit and
push on main; the public README download link points at main, so a build is only really shipped once
main has it.

## Standing rule: update the maintainer's SAVES, not just the build

A TTS save carries a COPY of every object's script. Dropping a fresh build into the Saves folder only
helps a game started from scratch: open a saved game, or let TTS autosave and resume, and the old
script comes back with it. On 2026-09-05 this bit for real -- 27 of 28 saves were stale, and he spent
a round reporting a box-score fix as broken while his save was silently reverting it.

So after every build, run BOTH:

    cp dist/Root_Tabletop_Tournament.json ~/Library/Tabletop\ Simulator/Saves/
    python3 tools/update_saves.py

update_saves.py rewrites only three fields on two objects (board bab7e1's LuaScript/XmlUI/
CustomUIAssets, and any "Root Box Score" LuaScript), so table state and every LuaScriptState -- the
gizmo config, the box score's recorded game -- survive untouched. Originals are backed up outside the
Saves folder, last two sets kept.

SCOPE: `Root_Tabletop_Tournament.json` ONLY. The maintainer said so plainly after a first pass
rewrote 26 files and a second still swept the autosaves. His saves are his. `--all` exists for a
sweep he explicitly asks for; it is never the default. NOTE the consequence, which is his to manage,
not something to route around: resuming from an autosave still restores the script stored in it.

## Standing rule: this file only shows OPEN work
The maintainer, 2026-09-04: "the work should always be cleaned up, and anything that is done needs to go
in the archive so the work is always clean". Tick an item, then run `python3 tools/queue_archive.py`
before committing -- it moves every `- [x]` into WORK_QUEUE_ARCHIVE.md and drops any section left empty.
The archive is kept rather than deleted because several entries record WHY something is the way it is,
and the root causes of bugs that took more than one attempt.

## Note for future sessions: the `m###` labels are HISTORY, not files
The `mods/` pipeline was REAL -- `mods/m###_*.py` + `build.py` over a `base/` mod. It is not in the
current history because the repo was RE-ROOTED onto the generator; the old chain survives only as
orphaned objects, now preserved as the tag **`legacy/mods-history`** (177 commits, tip 2026-08-30).
Read an old module with `git show legacy/mods-history:mods/m300_duchy_warriors.py`. That tag (and every
`legacy/*` / `discarded/*` tag) is **LOCAL-ONLY**: removed from GitHub on 2026-09-05 because the old
history carried the maintainer's real identity; rewritten locally so every commit is MrDrouf. Never
push tags -- `.git/hooks/pre-push` blocks them and any commit carrying the real name. The build is three
files -- `gen/src/save.json` (scene/blueprint, with an `@@BOARD_LUA@@` placeholder), `gen/src/content.lua`
(Root's object DATA) and `gen/src/logic.lua` (OUR code, the file you edit); `gen/assemble.py` injects
content+logic into the placeholder. Every `m###` reference in this file, CHANGELOG.md, TODO.md and
README.md names a change that is already BAKED INTO those three files -- do not go looking for a module.

Editing `gen/src/save.json`: it is CRLF. Read/write it in BINARY mode -- a text-mode round-trip in
Python rewrites all 2381 line endings and turns a one-character fix into a 4700-line diff.

## Golden rule (the maintainer, repeated + hardened)
**Fix the BLUEPRINT, never patch at runtime.** No dirty tricks — no spawn-then-move, no
spawn-below-the-table-then-reveal, no runtime tuck. Modify the faction's data so every piece
starts in its final container/position:
  - seat-relative pieces (warriors/buildings by the board): bake move_to (m290/m300/m560/m570).
  - "extra" pieces that belong in supply: MOVE them into the bag's ContainedObjects in the data
    (framework.stow_loose_in_bag) — they spawn inside the bag.
  - map-relative pieces (cats on clearings, The Pond): take from the supply bag / spawn the object
    JSON directly AT the final world spot — never a seat-local default first.

## STRUCTURAL — the pattern behind most of today's bugs (2026-09-04)

**Fault 2 struck again on 2026-09-04, twice in one evening.** Everything built for the box score's
seat colours and the TTS turn order lived in `rttSeatPlayers`, which ONLY the ranked draft calls -- so
on the manual 4-board path (`RTT Manual Selector`) there were no seat colours and no turn order at all,
and the maintainer, who tests on that path, saw uncoloured rows and TTS's own ten-colour default order.
Fixed by extracting `rttEnableTurns()` and calling it from both paths, and by dropping the `isDraft`
gate on the seat-colour publish. That is now the FOURTH thing these two paths have disagreed about
(teardown tags, run-state reset, busy release, hand-1 ordering) plus this one. Until they share a single
setup function, assume any new setup behaviour is missing from one of them.

The maintainer, after the supporters-hand saga: "this type of bug should give you some insight about
phenomena and problems in the structure of the code." He is right. Nearly every bug fixed today is one
of four structural faults, not an isolated mistake. Fixing these is worth more than fixing instances.

1. **Placement derived from MUTABLE GLOBAL STATE instead of from arguments.**
   `spawnSupportersHand(color)` takes only a colour and reads `Player[color].getHandTransform(1)`. So
   its result depends on WHEN it is called. makeFaction called it before moving hand 1, so the
   supporters hand was built from the player's PREVIOUS seat; the draft path happened to move hand 1
   much earlier, so it worked there. The same shape caused the box score binding rows by hand-zone
   geometry, and my own pin resolving Turns.order[1] through that geometry.
   FIX SHAPE: pass the seat position/rotation in explicitly. A function that is given where the seat is
   cannot be called "too early".

2. **TWO parallel setup paths that must stay in sync and don't share code** (rttSetup vs
   setupFactionBoards). Today alone they diverged on: the teardown tag list, the run-state reset
   (RTT_FAC_TAKEN etc.), the busy-flag release, and the hand-1 ordering above. Each was found separately.
   FIX SHAPE: one `rttNewGame()` and one `rttSpawnFactionAt()` that both paths call.

3. **Non-object state is invisible to teardown.** Teardown destroys objects by tag, but a game also
   leaves: hand-zone transforms (hand 2 stayed wherever the last Alliance put it), Globals
   (RTT_SEAT_POS / RTT_SEAT_COLOR), and module tables (RTT_FAC_TAKEN, RTT_VP_PENDING, RTT_ALLY_SUP_DONE,
   RTT_CAP_SPAWNED). Every one of these had to be remembered by hand, and each forgotten one was a bug.
   FIX SHAPE: a single registry of "things a new game resets", objects and state alike.

4. **Long async chains with no generation token.** ~6-10s of Wait.time/Wait.frames per setup, whose
   callbacks can fire against a later run's state. The busy guard stops a second run STARTING, but a
   chain already in flight is still unguarded.
   FIX SHAPE: rttSetup bumps RTT_RUN_ID; every deferred callback returns early if its captured id is stale.

## AWAITING A TEST AT THE TABLE

- [ ] **Seat colour cannot be re-taken after leaving it.** Reported 2026-09-05: "I was in that
      color, then I changed color to another seat, and then I'm not able to go back". Nothing in
      this mod destroys or reassigns a hand zone -- it only ever MOVES them -- so the cause is not
      ours. It matches a community-reported TTS bug: deleting an object that still has XML UI
      attached leaves the server unable to hand out colours, arrivals get only Grey, and a colour
      that has been left cannot be retaken, while the hand zones still look fine. This mod deletes
      XmlUI objects constantly (every manual selector board on a pick, every ranked selector, the box
      score on each respawn, everything cleared by tag at a new game), so it would trigger it far
      more than most.
      MITIGATION SHIPPED, NOT VERIFIED: rttDestroyUI clears an object's XML and destroys it a frame
      later, applied at every such site including the selector's own X button. Nothing available here
      can inspect TTS's colour state, so this needs the maintainer: pick factions, change seats a few
      times, and see whether the colour he left becomes available again. If it still happens, the
      next suspect is the box score, which rebuilds its XML every 1.2s.
