# RTT Work Queue

Single source of truth for outstanding tasks. Nothing is "done" until it's built, committed, and
Adrien has confirmed it in TTS. Keep this file live: add every new request here the moment it lands,
tick items only when committed, and re-open anything Adrien reports still broken.

## Golden rule (Adrien, repeated + hardened)
**Fix the BLUEPRINT, never patch at runtime.** No dirty tricks — no spawn-then-move, no
spawn-below-the-table-then-reveal, no runtime tuck. Modify the faction's data so every piece
starts in its final container/position:
  - seat-relative pieces (warriors/buildings by the board): bake move_to (m290/m300/m560/m570).
  - "extra" pieces that belong in supply: MOVE them into the bag's ContainedObjects in the data
    (framework.stow_loose_in_bag) — they spawn inside the bag.
  - map-relative pieces (cats on clearings, The Pond): take from the supply bag / spawn the object
    JSON directly AT the final world spot — never a seat-local default first.

## OPEN — active batch (2026-08-28)
- [x] Uploaded assets wired: Marsh 5p label -> FivePlayerArt (button neutral #ffffff); Lost City rules
      card -> new BackURL. Marsh5P button already spawns 5p Marsh via rttFivePStart.
- [x] Turn-order decks: 4-card (standard) / 5-card (5p) by RTT_DN (m250, _order_deck_4/5.json).
- [x] Winter/non-Marsh clearing markers: skip destruct+respawn on same-map re-click (m460).
- [x] Pond (frogs, no lizard): POND_FROG_POS -> (-30.882,11.562,10.661).
- [x] Cats: stand upright (rotation), calibrated centres (eyes was 180-flipped; Gorge = exact cats).
- [x] Seating: hand moved to board by turn order, all players seated (VERIFY in TTS).
- [x] **Crows** (DONE, VERIFY): m620 bakes 4 warriors (3 loose + un-stow the 4th) + the moved supply
      into the blueprint; removed the runtime warrior reposition. Hidden Zone (FogOfWarTrigger) spawned
      on the crow board, recoloured grey->crow player's seat colour (rttCrowsHiddenZone). **Side fixed**:
      board-local offset now (-3.163,-0.404) so positionToWorld rotates it to the RIGHT of the plots for
      ANY seat (board blueprint rotY=180); draft-path ONLY (isDraft flag, not the faction selector); and
      SKIPPED for 5-player seats 1-3 (RTT_SEATS nearest match). VERIFY in TTS: right side on every seat.
- [x] **Box score — FIXED format** (DONE, VERIFY): pinned showR (no column growth) + reserve nMin
      rows (4 ranked / 5 for 5p, via Global RTT_BOXSCORE_MIN set in rttSpawnBoxScore); blank placeholder
      rows fill empty slots, all interactive controls gated `not placeholder`. Grows past nMin for more
      players. No text resize by players/VP.
- [x] **Ruins ("runes") randomise on re-click** (DONE, verified in dist): RTT's Marsh ruins go through
      `rttShuffleList` (clean Fisher-Yates, no reseed); base-map ruins go through the base `shuffle()`
      (fixed by m600). Only 2 `randomseed(os.time())` calls remain and BOTH are top-level load-time seeds
      (m490's + the base script's) — zero per-click reseeds, so every re-click advances the stream = new
      layout. VERIFY in TTS: re-click a map a few times, ruin positions differ each time.
- [x] **Cold-load "setup board shows nothing until loaded twice"** (DONE, VERIFY): root cause = onLoad's
      `Wait.frames(setCustomAssets(assets), 100)` on bab7e1. It's redundant (saved CustomUIAssets already
      has all 541 icons, verified identical names+URLs) and on a COLD cache it replaces the asset table
      before the Steam downloads finish, blanking setupButtons with no re-render -> only a warm 2nd load
      recovered. m640 removes the call; TTS's own progressive render of the saved assets is left intact.
      VERIFY: fully quit TTS (cold cache), relaunch, load ONCE -> setup board should show immediately.

## OPEN

### Randomization / RNG (Adrien: "very dangerous") — DONE + PROVEN
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE fixed**: base shuffle() reseeded math.randomseed(os.time()) 101x/call + next
      frame -> deterministic-per-second, and shuffleMaps() runs it right before the landmark. m600
      replaces it with one clean Fisher-Yates, no reseed. Removed the per-draft reseed (m250) too.
      Now 2 seeds total, both load-time. PROVEN by sim: old = identical for 3 same-second clicks;
      fixed landmark uniform 25% (chi-sq 2.10), floods 50/50 per pair.
- [x] Mountain landmark fast (Wait.frames 2), self-clears; Marsh floods re-randomise instantly.
- [x] Marsh number tokens rest on the board (11.635).

### Draft / seating flow — DONE (needs Adrien's TTS test; big change)
- [x] **Remove pick-map / pick-deck**: rttBeginPick skips the pick, spawns boards immediately.
      5-player button still auto-places Marsh.
- [x] **Fixed board/seat count** = RTT_DN-1 -> fixes the 2-player bug.
- [x] **Seating (REVISED per Adrien's report)**: do NOT move hands / change colour (that caused the
      "hand under the table" + wrong-seat bug). rttSeatPlayers matches each seated player to the board
      at THEIR OWN seat (nearest to where they sit) and deals the turn-order card into their existing
      hand. Order deck stays ON the table (turn order isn't secret). Turn order is random.
- [x] **Restrict**: rttCoordFaction only lets a player pick on their OWN seat's board (no seat conflicts).
- [x] **Simultaneous**: every board lights at once; fixed faction slots (no race).
- [x] **Knave Captains**: unlocked, laid FACE-UP in Adrien's line (x 53.5, z -8..+7.4); source deck
      spawned below the table so the 8 undrafted captains never show. "Pick your faction" text removed.
  VERIFY in TTS: nearest-seat board matching, restrict, captain line, real 4-player draft resolves.

### Maps / landmarks
- [x] **Marsh 5-player map button REPLACES Swol Birbs** (DONE): "Swol Birbs" was a *separate* fan-
      faction tool button at x=57 (an earlier agent wrongly thought it WAS the Marsh5P button). Fixed:
      m500 moves the Marsh5P button (id `Marsh5P`, onclick `rttFivePStart`, icon `FivePlayerArt` =
      Adrien's Marsh 5p label art, URL 622AC9B1) into the x=57 slot; m630 removes the Swol Birbs button
      + its EVERYTHING['Tools']['Swol Birbs'] data. Bottom option row now ends at the Marsh 5p button.
- [x] **Mountain landmark direct spawn** (DONE): m590 removes the central clearing marker (1b3b99)
      from the Mountain data at build time (11 markers spawn, shuffleMaps is count-safe);
      rttMountainLandmark no longer reads/destroys a marker — spawns a random landmark directly.
- [x] **Landmark explanation cards — flip** (DONE): m490 Mountain landmark now passes crotZ 180
      (RULES/BackURL face up). Marsh 5p towns already correct.
- [x] **Lost City rules-card art (outdated)** (DONE, verified): m610 swapped the card's outdated RULES
      face (BackURL) to Adrien's new Steam upload. Verified in dist: new URL `.../11026657163450986659/
      01C4A12996D5C47049E1BA794CC33AC10F9AF662/` present, old `.../1859433736252751364/0DC4B26C.../` gone.

### Golden-rule cleanup — DONE
- [x] **Crows warriors** (DONE): Adrien set up Corvid + saved; m620 bakes the 4 warriors the verified
      way (3 loose move_to'd 8b4f9c/b66f9e/d78475 + un-stow the 4th 29769e from the supply bag) plus the
      moved supply bag 653be4. Runtime warrior reposition removed from rttCrowsPlots. All 5 GUIDs verified
      present in the dist blueprint.

## DONE (this session, pending Adrien's confirmation in TTS)
- [x] Bats (Twilight Council): 6 warriors + 6 assemblies baked into blueprint (m560); rttBatsSetup removed.
- [x] **Marquise (proper blueprint fix)**: 8 of the 11 loose warriors MOVED into the supply bag
      (framework.stow_loose_in_bag); 3 staging warriors baked below the 3 starting buildings (z 5.4,
      m570 — nudge if off); cats come from the bag. Total 25 (3 staging + 12/15 map + 10/7 bag).
      Fixed the m570 bug that was corrupting the supply bag's own move_to.
- [x] Cats on clearings: placed on true clearing CENTRES per map (RTT_CLEARING_CENTRES, from eyes
      geometry), from the supply bag. 12 standard / 4p-Marsh (skip 3 flooded); **15 on 5p-Marsh**.
- [x] **Duchy (proper blueprint fix)**: the 8th warrior MOVED into the Duchy Supply bag in the data
      (7 loose + 13 bagged); removed the below-table hack + deleted rttDuchyTuck.
- [x] **The Pond (proper fix)**: REMOVED from the frog blueprint (m580); spawned directly at its
      world spot from RTT_POND_JSON (rttSpawnPond) — no below-table, no reposition.
- [x] Marsh number tokens: deliberate token positions + skip-and-renumber (m460).
- [x] Marquise Keep enlarged (m550); Lizard wizard direction + Outcast marker (m490).
- [x] framework.stow_loose_in_bag: new primitive to move a loose blueprint piece into a bag.
